Build A Markdown To HTML Conversion Pipeline Using Python
I wanted to serve my own blog instead of using websites like Medium. It was a pretty basic blog and I wrote all my articles in HTML. However, some day, I came across the idea of writing my own markdown to HTML generator, which would eventually allow me to write my articles in markdown. Furthermore, extending it by features like estimated reading time would be easier. Long story short, I implemented my own markdown to HTML generator and I really like it!
